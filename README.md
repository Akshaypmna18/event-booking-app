## Features

- **React 19** - Latest React framework for building user interfaces[1]
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety and better development experience[1]
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server[1]
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development[1]
- **TanStack Query** - Powerful asynchronous state management and server-state utilities for data fetching, caching, and synchronization[2][3]
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management[1]
- **React Router** - Client-side routing and navigation[1]
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives[1]
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon library[1]
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Vitest with Testing Library for unit and integration tests[1]
- **Code Quality** - ESLint for code linting and quality assurance[1]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`** - Start the development server with Vite
- **`npm run build`** - Build the project for production (TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
- **`npm run preview`** - Preview the production build locally
- **`npm run lint`** - Run ESLint to check code quality
- **`npm run test`** - Run tests using Vitest
- **`npm run test:ui`** - Run tests with interactive UI dashboard
- **`npm run test:coverage`** - Generate test coverage report

## Project Structure

This project uses a modular architecture with:

- Type-safe React components with TypeScript[1]
- Tailwind CSS for styling with class utilities[1]
- TanStack Query for declarative data fetching with automatic caching and background refetching[4][5]
- Zustand stores for state management[1]
- React Router for navigation between pages[1]
- Radix UI components for accessible UI patterns[1]

## Development Workflow

1. **Development**: Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server
2. **Testing**: Write tests alongside your components and run `npm run test`
3. **Linting**: Keep code quality high with `npm run lint`
4. **Building**: Create a production build with `npm run build`
